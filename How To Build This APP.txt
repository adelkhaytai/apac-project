hereâ€™s a more detailed approach for both backend and frontend steps:

Backend Improvements:
Install Necessary Packages:
-express: For handling routes and middleware.
-mongoose: To interact with MongoDB.
-dotenv: For environment variables.
-cors: To handle cross-origin requests.
-bcryptjs: For hashing passwords (if needed).
-jsonwebtoken: For authentication using tokens.
-nodemon: For auto-reloading the server during development.
Server Setup with .env
Create Routes, Controllers, and Middleware
Test API with Insomnia

Frontend Improvements:
Create React App and Folder Structure Install and create a React app
State Management with Redux Toolkit
Clean API Integration with Redux Toolkit
User & Admin Components for Events
Display Event List on Home Page


This approach improves the structure of both the backend and frontend, leveraging proper package usage, clear API management with Redux Toolkit, and a clean folder structure for scalability
